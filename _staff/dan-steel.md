I first started on my yogic path back in 2008 while I was enrolled in an intro to Eastern philosophy course at Berklee. My professor at the time sparked my interest in Transcendental Meditation, a technique that has its roots in the yoga tradition, which I promptly learned later that semester. Shortly thereafter I discovered the asana practice, also while in college. Having a background in martial arts and gymnastics, I was immediately drawn to the physically demanding aspects of the asanas and the focus that it required. Not long after establishing a regular practice, while in conjunction with daily meditation, did I begin to recognize the powerful potential in yoga for healing and self-discovery. I believe that the strength, flexibility, and balance cultivated in the body through asana can be reflected in the mind.

Every time one steps onto the yoga mat, there is the opportunity for growth and greater understanding of the self, both physically and spiritually, if the practice is approached with the appropriate degree of focus, patience, and dedication. The more we come to understand ourselves, the more we can act in accordance with our true nature, instead of living in repression and inauthenticity

I have completed both the Foundational and Advanced trainings with Ana Forrest, a 200 hour vinyasa training with Ame Wren at Back Bay Yoga, and the Budokon Yoga training with Cameron Shayne. In addition to my continued yoga studies and practice, I am being trained in the system of Z-Health, in short a fitness system informed by current neuroscience that focuses on improving the connection between brain and body. In my classes I strive to offer a platform upon which students can explore and develop a heightened sense of body awareness and overall focus.
